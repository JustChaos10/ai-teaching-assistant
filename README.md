## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., OpenAI, Gradio, Torch, etc. depending on your modules)
- (Optional) Webcam for image-based activities

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following (example):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

⚠️ Never commit `.env` with real secrets to GitHub.

## 📌 Notes

- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files (`.env`, `__pycache__`, executables).  
- Large datasets or images should be stored externally or added to `.gitignore`.  
- This project is modular — add new games by creating a Python module and linking it in `game_manager.py`.

## 🎯 Roadmap

- Add more AI-driven activities
- Improve computer vision modules
- Expand teacher dashboard with analytics
- Support for multilingual prompts
