# Complete Setup Guide for Humanoid Teaching Assistant Project

## Project Overview
This is a **Humanoid Teaching Assistant** system with:
- Animated cartoon avatar with speech synthesis
- Voice interaction with wake word "Jarvis"
- Educational games with computer vision (placard detection, finger counting)
- Teacher interface for creating custom learning modules
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for educational content

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python Environment
- **Python 3.8+** (3.9-3.11 recommended)
- **Virtual environment** (highly recommended)

### 2. Hardware Requirements
- **Webcam** (for placard detection and finger counting games)
- **Microphone** (for voice interaction)
- **Speakers/Headphones** (for text-to-speech output)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Python Virtual Environment Setup

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\College notes\Capstone Project\Capstone"

# Create virtual environment (choose one method):
python -m venv teachbot_env
# OR
python3 -m venv teachbot_env

# Activate virtual environment:
# On Windows:
teachbot\Scripts\activate 
# On macOS/Linux:
source teachbot_env/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install main project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install additional PyTorch dependencies:
```bash
# For CPU-only (if no NVIDIA GPU):
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# For NVIDIA GPU support:
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Install additional dependencies for games:
```bash
cd "image detector"
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

### Step 4: Environment Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: You need to set up API keys in `backend/.env`:

1. **Edit the .env file**:
   - The file already contains API keys, but verify they're still valid
   - You may need to get your own Groq API key from https://console.groq.com/

2. **Required API Keys**:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 5: Create Required Directories

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p teaching_modules
mkdir -p teaching_modules/resources
mkdir -p active_modules
mkdir -p temp_images
mkdir -p sounds
mkdir -p docs
```

### Step 6: Test Audio Setup

Run this to check your audio devices:
```bash
python -c "
import pyaudio
p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
print('Audio devices:')
for i in range(p.get_device_count()):
    info = p.get_device_info_by_index(i)
    if info['maxInputChannels'] > 0:
        print(f'  {i}: {info[\"name\"]}')
p.terminate()
"
```

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Main Teaching Assistant (Recommended)

```bash
python py_app.py
```

This launches the main application with:
- Animated avatar
- Voice interaction (wake word: "Hey Jarvis")
- All integrated games and features

### Option 2: Teacher Interface for Creating Modules

```bash
python launch_teacher_interface.py
```

This launches the GUI for teachers to:
- Create custom learning modules
- Upload educational resources
- Configure interaction methods
- Deploy modules to the teaching assistant

### Option 3: Individual Games

Navigate to the games directory and run specific games:
```bash
cd "image detector"
python main_ui.py          # Games menu
python finger_counting_game.py    # Finger counting game
python fruits_vs_vegetables.py    # Classification game
python healthyVSjunk.py          # Healthy food game
```

## Usage Instructions

### For the Main Teaching Assistant:

1. **Start the application**: `python py_app.py`
2. **Wait for initialization** (may take 30-60 seconds first time)
3. **Wake word activation**: Say "Hey Jarvis" or "Jarvis"
4. **Ask questions** like:
   - "Tell me about math"
   - "I want to play a counting game"
   - "Show me the games menu"
   - "What is 2 + 2?"

### For the Teacher Interface:

1. **Launch**: `python launch_teacher_interface.py`
2. **Create modules** with custom:
   - Questions and activities
   - Images and resources
   - Interaction methods (voice, placard, finger counting)
3. **Deploy modules** to the main teaching assistant
4. **Test modules** directly in the interface

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Audio Issues:
- **Microphone not detected**: Check Windows privacy settings for microphone access
- **No audio output**: Verify speakers/headphones are working
- **Wake word not working**: Try different microphone or adjust sensitivity

### Camera Issues:
- **Camera not found**: Check if other applications are using the camera
- **Permission denied**: Grant camera permissions to Python/terminal

### Dependencies Issues:
- **Import errors**: Make sure virtual environment is activated
- **PyTorch installation**: Install appropriate version for your system
- **PyQt6 issues**: Try `pip install PyQt6 --force-reinstall`

### Performance Issues:
- **Slow startup**: First run downloads AI models (normal)
- **High CPU usage**: Consider using CPU-only PyTorch if no GPU
- **Memory issues**: Close other applications, ensure 8GB+ RAM

## Demo Workflow for Evaluation

### 1. Teacher Workflow Demo:
```bash
python launch_teacher_interface.py
```
- Create a new module: "Animal Classification"
- Subject: Science
- Input Method: Placard (Yes/No)
- Add question: "Is this a mammal?"
- Upload animal images
- Save and deploy the module

### 2. Student Workflow Demo:
```bash
python py_app.py
```
- Say "Hey Jarvis" to activate
- Ask: "What can you teach me?"
- Try: "Launch finger counting game"
- Show finger counting with camera
- Try: "Show me fruits and vegetables game"
- Use GREEN/RED placards for yes/no responses

### 3. Direct Game Demo:
```bash
cd "image detector"
python main_ui.py
```
- Try each game from the menu
- Show different interaction methods

## Voice Commands for Students

- "Hey Jarvis" - Activate the assistant
- "Launch finger counting game" - Start finger counting activity
- "Start healthy food game" - Begin nutrition game
- "Show me fruits and vegetables game" - Open classification game
- "What games can you teach me?" - List available activities
- "I want to learn about math" - Get math-related content
- "Show games menu" - Open game selection interface

## Technical Architecture

- **Voice Recognition**: RealtimeSTT with "Jarvis" wake word
- **Text-to-Speech**: ChatTTS for natural speech synthesis
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for placard/finger detection
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 for desktop interfaces
- **AI Backend**: Groq LLM with RAG system
- **Game Engine**: Pygame for interactive games
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for teaching modules

## Performance Tips

- Close unnecessary applications to free up camera/microphone
- Ensure good lighting for camera-based games
- Speak clearly and at normal volume for voice recognition
- Use solid colored placards (bright green and red work best)
- Keep background relatively simple for better detection

## Directories Created Automatically

After first run, the system creates:
```
├── teaching_modules/        # Teacher-created modules
├── teaching_modules/resources/  # Uploaded images/files
├── active_modules/          # Deployed modules for students
├── temp_images/            # Generated placeholder images
└── sounds/                 # Audio files for games
```

## Dependencies Summary

### Main Requirements (requirements.txt):
- python-dotenv, pypdf, docx2txt, python-pptx
- sentence-transformers, langchain-groq, faiss-cpu
- torch, torchaudio, transformers
- RealtimeSTT, flask, flask-socketio
- PyQt6, gradio, pydub

### Games Requirements (image detector/requirements.txt):
